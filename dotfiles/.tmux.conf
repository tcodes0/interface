## By default, all windows in a session are constrained to the size of the
## smallest client connected to that session, even if both clients are
## looking at different windows. It seems that in this particular case, Screen
## has the better default where a window is only constrained in size if a
## smaller client is actively looking at it. This behaviour can be fixed by
## setting tmux's aggressive-resize option.

## Upon starting to use tmux, I noticed that I had to add a noticeable delay
## between two characters in a command sequence for it to recognize the
## command, for example between the C-a and n in C-a n. This is because tmux is
## waiting for an escape sequence. Fix that by setting escape time to zero.
