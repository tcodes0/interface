	// Place your snippets for shellscript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"insert if clause": {
		"prefix": "if",
		"body": [
      "if [ \"$$1\" ]; then",
      "  $2",
      "fi"
    ],
		"description": "insert if clause"
	},
	"shellcheck disable directive": {
		"prefix": "shell",
		"body": [
      "# shellcheck disable=SC$1",
    ],
		"description": "shellcheck disable directive"
	},
	"[ ] && do": {
		"prefix": "test",
		"body": [
      "[ \"$$1\" ] && $0",
    ],
		"description": "shellcheck disable directive"
	}
